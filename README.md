# BWA rowdfunding

## Description
This project is based on the **Build with Angga** learning flow, enhanced with custom improvisations. It involves developing a full-stack web application with a Vue.js-based front-end, a Golang-based back-end, and a MySQL database.

### **Learning Flow**
1. **Slicing HTML to Vue Template**  
   - Create the user interface using HTML and CSS, then integrate it into Vue.js components for a dynamic and responsive layout.

2. **Back-End Development with Golang**  
   - Build efficient and scalable APIs using Golang to connect the front-end and the database.

3. **Front-End Development with NuxtJS**  
   - Develop the front-end using NuxtJS, a Vue-based framework, for a modern, server-side rendered (SSR) experience.

4. **Personal Improvisations**  
   - Added custom features and optimizations to improve functionality, user experience, and performance.
